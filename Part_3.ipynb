        "15. **Bayesian Regression:** Bayesian regression incorporates Bayesian techniques to estimate model parameters, providing a probabilistic view of the model's uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM):** GLMs are a broad class of regression models that include linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression as special cases. They allow for different types of response variables and distributions.\n",

        "\n",
        "**1. Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** The primary purpose of regression is to predict a continuous numerical value. It is used when the output variable is quantitative and represents a quantity, such as price, temperature, or age.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification:** Classification aims to assign input data to predefined categories or classes. It is used when the output variable is categorical and represents a label or class, such as spam or not spam, disease or no disease, or handwritten digit recognition (0-9).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Output Variable:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** In regression, the output variable (also known as the dependent variable) is continuous and can take any value within a specific range.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** Regression algorithms aim to model the relationship between input variables and a continuous output by fitting a curve or a plane to the data. Common regression algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, and decision tree regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification:** Classification algorithms focus on separating data into classes or categories. Popular classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** To evaluate regression models, common metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).\n",

        "**5. Example Use Cases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** Regression is used for predicting numerical values, such as predicting house prices, stock prices, temperature, or sales revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification:** Classification is used for tasks like spam email detection, sentiment analysis, image recognition (e.g., identifying cats vs. dogs), and medical diagnosis (e.g., disease vs. no disease).\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Output Interpretation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** The output of a regression model can be directly interpreted as a real-number quantity. For example, if a regression model predicts a house price of $300,000$, it means the predicted price is $300,000$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification:** In classification, the output represents class labels. For example, if a classifier predicts a label \"spam,\" it means the input is classified as spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Decision Boundary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression:** Regression models do not have a decision boundary since they predict continuous values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification:** Classification models have decision boundaries that separate data points into different classes or categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the key difference between regression and classification lies in their objectives: regression predicts continuous values, while classification assigns data points to discrete categories or classes. The choice between regression and classification depends on the nature of the problem and the type of output variable you are working with."

        "Here are the key components and characteristics of linear regression:\n",
        "\n",

        "   - $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (the value of $y$ when $x$ is 0).\n",
        "   - $\\beta_1$ is the slope (the change in $y$ for a unit change in $x$).\n",
        "   - $\\varepsilon$ represents the error term, which accounts for the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fitting the Line:** The goal is to find the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the sum of squared differences (residuals) between the predicted values and the actual values in the dataset. This process is often referred to as \"ordinary least squares\" (OLS) regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions. Given new values of the independent variable(s), the model can estimate the corresponding dependent variable value.\n",

        "5. **Types of Linear Regression:**\n",
        "   - **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves one independent variable.\n",

        "   - **Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:** Include regularization terms to prevent overfitting in multiple linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Assumptions:** Linear regression assumes certain conditions like linearity, independence of errors, constant variance (homoscedasticity), and normality of errors in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Evaluation Metrics:** Common evaluation metrics for linear regression models include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).\n",

It is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted values generated by a model and the actual (ground truth) values in the dataset. The purpose of a loss function is to quantify how well or poorly a machine learning model is performing concerning its predictive task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objectives of a loss function are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Evaluation:** It provides a quantitative measure of how well the model's predictions align with the actual data. A lower loss value indicates better model performance.\n",

        "- **Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss):** Frequently used in classification tasks, cross-entropy loss quantifies the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and actual class labels. It encourages the model to assign high probabilities to the correct class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hinge Loss:** Used in support vector machines (SVMs) and other classifiers, hinge loss penalizes predictions that are less confident in classifying data points correctly.\n",

        "**Gradient descent** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function and find the optimal parameters of a machine learning model. It is a fundamental technique employed in training various machine learning models, including linear regression, neural networks, and support vector machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how gradient descent works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:** Gradient descent begins by initializing the model's parameters with some initial values. These parameters could include weights and biases in the case of linear regression or neural network weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Optimization:** The algorithm iteratively updates the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. The key idea is to adjust the parameters in the direction of steepest descent (negative gradient) of the loss function. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Learning Rate:** A hyperparameter called the **learning rate** is crucial in gradient descent. It determines the size of each step taken during parameter updates. A higher learning rate may result in faster convergence but could overshoot the minimum, while a lower learning rate may slow down convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Gradient Calculation:** In each iteration, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters is computed. The gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of the steepest increase in the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Parameter Update:** The model's parameters are adjusted based on the gradient and learning rate. The general update rule for a parameter θ is:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   θ = θ - (learning_rate) * (gradient of the loss with respect to θ)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Convergence:** The algorithm continues to update parameters iteratively until one of the stopping conditions is met. Common stopping conditions include reaching a maximum number of iterations, achieving a minimum acceptable loss, or observing negligible changes in the parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient descent comes in several variants, including **batch gradient descent**, **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**, and **mini-batch gradient descent**. These variants differ in how they use data during each iteration:\n",
        "\n",

        "Linear regression is a simple yet powerful statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. However, it has some limitations and drawbacks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Linearity Assumption:** Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. If the true relationship is nonlinear, linear regression may provide biased and inaccurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sensitivity to Outliers:** Linear regression is sensitive to outliers in the data. Outliers can disproportionately influence the regression coefficients, leading to a model that doesn't generalize well.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Assumption of Independence:** It assumes that the errors (residuals) are independent of each other. Violations of this assumption, such as autocorrelation in time series data, can lead to unreliable parameter estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Assumption of Homoscedasticity:** Linear regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (heteroscedasticity), the model may have lower predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Assumption of Normality:** Linear regression assumes that the errors are normally distributed. If the errors do not follow a normal distribution, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests may not be valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Multicollinearity:** When independent variables are highly correlated with each other, multicollinearity can occur. This makes it challenging to interpret the individual effects of each variable and can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Overfitting:** Linear regression can be prone to overfitting when the model is too complex relative to the amount of data available. Regularization techniques like ridge and lasso regression can help mitigate this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Limited Expressiveness:** Linear regression may not capture complex relationships in the data. In cases where the true relationship is highly nonlinear, other machine learning algorithms like decision trees or neural networks may be more appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Limited to Continuous Outcomes:** Linear regression is primarily used for predicting continuous numeric outcomes. It may not be suitable for problems with categorical or binary outcomes (e.g., classification tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Model Assumptions:** Linear regression relies on several assumptions, including linearity, independence of errors, constant variance, and normality of residuals. If these assumptions are violated, the model's results may be unreliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these limitations, linear regression remains a valuable tool for many applications, especially when the underlying relationships are approximately linear and the assumptions are met. In cases where these limitations are significant, more advanced regression techniques or machine learning models may be considered."

        "\n",
        "**Bias:** Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) by a simplified model. It can be thought of as the difference between the predicted values by the model and the actual outcomes in the training data. High bias indicates that the model is too simplistic and unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This can result in underfitting, where the model performs poorly both on the training and unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variance:** Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations or noise in the training data. It measures how much the model's predictions would vary if we trained it on different subsets of the data. High variance indicates that the model is overly complex and is fitting the noise in the training data, rather than the true underlying patterns. This can result in overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data because it has essentially memorized the training examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a more detailed explanation of these concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bias:**\n",
        "- High bias means the model is too simple and doesn't capture the complexity of the data.\n",
        "- It often leads to underfitting, where the model's predictions are consistently off the mark.\n",
        "- Underfit models have high training error and high test error.\n",
        "- Addressing bias typically involves increasing model complexity, such as using a more flexible algorithm or increasing the number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variance:**\n",
        "- High variance means the model is too complex and fits the noise in the data.\n",
        "- It often leads to overfitting, where the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "- Overfit models have low training error but high test error.\n",
        "- Addressing variance typically involves reducing model complexity, using techniques like regularization, increasing the amount of training data, or reducing the number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trade-off between bias and variance is a fundamental concept in machine learning. Ideally, you want to find the right balance where your model is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns but not so complex that it fits noise. Techniques like cross-validation and learning curves can help you diagnose whether your model has a bias or variance problem.\n",

They both work by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, discouraging the model from fitting noise and reducing the complexity of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an explanation of each:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):**\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.\n",
        "   - The cost function for Ridge Regression is represented as J(θ) = MSE(θ) + λΣθi², where θ represents the model coefficients, MSE(θ) is the mean squared error term, λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter, and Σθi² represents the sum of the squared coefficients.\n",
        "   - The effect of Ridge Regression is to push the coefficients of less important features closer to zero but not exactly to zero. It can shrink the coefficients but doesn't eliminate any of them.\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression is useful when there is multicollinearity in the dataset (high correlation between independent variables) because it can distribute the impact of correlated features more evenly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):**\n",
        "   - Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients.\n",
        "   - The cost function for Lasso Regression is represented as J(θ) = MSE(θ) + λΣ|θi|, where the symbols have the same meanings as in Ridge Regression.\n",
        "   - Lasso Regression has a stronger feature selection property compared to Ridge Regression. It tends to drive the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero, effectively removing them from the model.\n",
        "   - Lasso Regression is particularly useful when you suspect that only a subset of the features is relevant to the target variable, and you want to automatically select the most important features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but doesn't eliminate them, making it suitable for situations where all features may have some degree of importance.\n",
        "- Lasso Regression can lead to feature selection by driving the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero, making it suitable for situations where feature sparsity or selection is desirable.\n",
        "- The choice between Ridge and Lasso often depends on the specific problem, and sometimes a combination of both techniques, known as Elastic Net, is used to balance their effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In both cases, the regularization parameter (λ) controls the strength of the regularization. Choosing an appropriate value for λ is crucial, and techniques like cross-validation are often used to find the optimal value that balances model complexity and performance."

It's a supervised learning algorithm that is simple to understand and interpret. Decision Trees are often used in decision-making processes, and they mimic the structure of human decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key characteristics and components of a Decision Tree:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tree Structure:** A Decision Tree is structured like an upside-down tree, with a root node at the top, internal nodes in the middle, and leaf nodes at the bottom. Each node represents a decision or a test on an attribute, and each branch represents an outcome or decision based on the test.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Root Node:** The top node in the tree is the root node. It represents the initial decision or attribute used to split the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Internal Nodes:** Internal nodes represent intermediary decisions or attributes used to further split the data into subsets. Each internal node tests a specific attribute or condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Leaf Nodes:** Leaf nodes are the final nodes at the bottom of the tree. They represent the predicted output or class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Edges:** Edges or branches connect nodes and represent the outcome of a decision or test. They lead to either another internal node or a leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Decision Rules:** The path from the root node to a leaf node represents a decision rule that can be followed to make predictions or classify data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of creating a Decision Tree involves selecting the best attribute to split the data at each internal node. The selection is based on a criterion such as Gini impurity (for classification tasks) or mean squared error (for regression tasks). The goal is to minimize the impurity or error in the resulting subsets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Trees have several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy to understand and interpret: Decision Trees provide a clear visualization of decision rules.\n",
        "- Can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
        "- Suitable for multi-class classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "- Robust to outliers and noisy data.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Decision Trees can also have limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prone to overfitting: Decision Trees can create overly complex models that fit the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.\n",
        "- Instability: Small changes in the data can lead to different tree structures, which makes them unstable.\n",
        "- Biased toward dominant classes: In classification tasks, Decision Trees tend to favor classes with more data points.\n",
        "- Limited expressiveness: For certain complex relationships, Decision Trees may not capture subtle patterns effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "To overcome some of these limitations, ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees are often used, which combine the predictions of multiple Decision Trees to improve overall performance."

        "In a decision tree, there are several key terminologies and concepts that are important to understand:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Root Node:** The topmost node in the decision tree. It represents the initial decision or test on the dataset. The root node splits the dataset into subsets based on a specific attribute or condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Internal Node:** Nodes in the decision tree that are not leaf nodes. Internal nodes represent intermediary decisions or tests on attributes. Each internal node checks a specific attribute or condition and further splits the data into subsets based on the outcome of the test.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Leaf Node (Terminal Node):** The bottom nodes of the decision tree. These nodes do not have any child nodes and represent the final outcome or prediction. In classification tasks, each leaf node corresponds to a class label, while in regression tasks, it represents a numerical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Branch (Edge):** The edges or branches in the decision tree connect nodes. They represent the outcome or result of a test conducted at an internal node. A branch leads to either another internal node or a leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Decision Rule:** The path from the root node to a specific leaf node represents a decision rule. This rule is used to make predictions or classify data points. Each internal node along the path contributes to the decision rule by testing an attribute or condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Attribute (Feature):** Attributes are the characteristics or variables used to split the dataset at internal nodes. In classification tasks, attributes are often the features of the data, and in regression tasks, they are the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Test (Split):** A test is performed at each internal node to determine which branch to follow. The test is based on an attribute and a condition, such as \"Is attribute A greater than 5?\" The outcome of the test determines whether the left or right branch is followed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Parent Node:** In the context of internal nodes, the parent node is the node that leads to a specific internal node. For leaf nodes, the parent node is the internal node from which the branch originates.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Child Node:** In the context of internal nodes, child nodes are the nodes that follow a specific internal node. Child nodes represent subsets of the data resulting from the split at the parent node.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Depth of the Tree:** The depth of the decision tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. It represents the number of decisions or tests required to reach a prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Pruning:** Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of a decision tree by removing branches that do not significantly improve predictive accuracy. It helps prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Gini Impurity:** A measure of impurity or disorder used in classification tasks. It quantifies the likelihood of misclassifying a randomly chosen element.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Entropy:** Another measure of impurity used in classification tasks. It quantifies the level of disorder or uncertainty in a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Information Gain:** A metric used to measure the effectiveness of a particular attribute in reducing impurity or uncertainty. It helps in deciding which attribute to use for splitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Gain Ratio:** A modification of information gain that takes into account the number of branches created by splitting an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "These terminologies are essential for understanding how decision trees work, how they make decisions, and how they can be interpreted. They play a crucial role in the construction and interpretation of decision tree models."

        "Handling missing data is a critical step in data preprocessing to ensure that your machine learning models can work effectively. There are various methods to handle missing data, and the choice of method depends on the nature of the data and the problem you're working on. Here are some common methods for handling missing data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Removal of Missing Values:** In some cases, you may choose to remove rows or columns with missing values. This is suitable when the amount of missing data is relatively small, and removing the missing values doesn't significantly affect the integrity of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Remove rows with any missing values\n",
        "   df.dropna(inplace=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Remove columns with any missing values\n",
        "   df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Imputation:** Imputation involves filling in missing values with estimated or calculated values. Some common imputation techniques include:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Mean, Median, or Mode Imputation:** Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     df['column_name'].fillna(df['column_name'].mean(), inplace=True)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Forward Fill (ffill) or Backward Fill (bfill):** Use the previous or next value to fill in missing values, often applicable to time series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     df['column_name'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Impute with a Specific Value:** Fill missing values with a predefined constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     df['column_name'].fillna(value, inplace=True)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Regression Imputation:** Use regression models to predict missing values based on other variables in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Advanced Techniques:** More advanced methods like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) imputation, matrix factorization, or deep learning can be applied when dealing with complex data and large amounts of missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\n",
        "\n",
        "   imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)\n",
        "   df_filled = imputer.fit_transform(df)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Categorical Data:** When dealing with categorical features, you can impute missing values with the mode (most frequent category) or create a new category for missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   df['categorical_column'].fillna(df['categorical_column'].mode()[0], inplace=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Time Series Data:** For time series data, interpolation methods like linear or cubic spline interpolation can be used to estimate missing values based on adjacent data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   df['time_series_column'].interpolate(method='linear', inplace=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of method should be made carefully, considering the nature of your data, the extent of missing values, and the potential impact on your analysis or modeling. Always remember to validate the chosen method's suitability and impact on your project's objectives."

        "Finding correlations between features is a crucial step in data analysis and can provide valuable insights into how variables relate to each other. Correlation analysis helps you understand the strength and direction of relationships between pairs of features. Here's how you can find correlations between features in your dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Correlation Coefficient:** The most common metric for measuring correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted as \\(r\\). It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - To compute the Pearson correlation coefficient in Python, you can use the `corr()` method of a DataFrame in libraries like Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     correlation_matrix = df.corr()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - You can visualize the correlation matrix as a heatmap for a more intuitive understanding of the relationships between features using libraries like Seaborn or Matplotlib.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     import seaborn as sns\n",
        "     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
        "\n",
        "     plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n",
        "     sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=\".2f\")\n",
        "     plt.show()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Positive values of \\(r\\) indicate a positive linear relationship, while negative values suggest a negative linear relationship. The closer \\(r\\) is to 1 or -1, the stronger the correlation. A value close to 0 implies a weak or no linear correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Correlation Threshold:** You can set a correlation threshold to identify pairs of features with correlations above a certain value. This can be helpful when you want to focus on highly correlated features or exclude those with weak correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   threshold = 0.7  # Define your correlation threshold\n",
        "   high_correlation_pairs = []\n",
        "\n",
        "   for i in range(len(correlation_matrix.columns)):\n",
        "       for j in range(i):\n",
        "           if abs(correlation_matrix.iloc[i, j]) > threshold:\n",
        "               high_correlation_pairs.append((correlation_matrix.columns[i], correlation_matrix.columns[j]))\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Spearman and Kendall Correlations:** Besides Pearson correlation, you can also compute Spearman and Kendall correlations. These metrics are non-parametric and suitable for data with non-linear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Spearman correlation is used for ordinal or ranked data.\n",
        "   - Kendall correlation measures the strength of ordinal associations between two measured quantities.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   spearman_correlation = df.corr(method='spearman')\n",
        "   kendall_correlation = df.corr(method='kendall')\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Domain-Specific Analysis:** Depending on your domain knowledge and the nature of your data, you may also want to perform domain-specific correlation analyses or consider additional factors such as causality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. High correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that one causes the other; it could be coincidental or influenced by a third variable. Therefore, it's essential to interpret correlation results carefully and consider the broader context of your analysis."
